<h1> We Need Your Resistance To Save Our Existence! </h1>
<p class="double">
Climate is changing and impacting Earth in a negative way. 
Climate change has a lot of negative effects on the environment and it is mostly because of the people. 
If people can change their habits to reduce the greenhouse gases emissions, 
then we might be able to save uncountable amount of species as well as humans. 
At its worst condition, global warming could wipe out and destroy all the species through natural causes.
Climate change, which is also called global warming, refers to the rise in average surface temperatures on Earth.
Climate change is happening because of the human use of fossil fuels, that release carbon dioxide and other gases 
known as greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases are gases that are released into the atmosphere because
of the daily human activities. These gases trap the heat in the atmosphere which eventually leads to a warmer Earth.
There are several types of greenhouse gases that are being added to the atmosphere. Some of those gases are Carbon dioxide,
Methane, Nitrous oxide, and Fluorinated gases. Carbon dioxide is the most released gas from our human activities followed 
by other types of gases mentioned above. The levels of these atmospheric gases are increasing rapidly which can eventually 
lead to a warmer Earth according to the greenhouse effect. “The greenhouse gas effect refers to the way the Earth’s atmosphere 
traps some of the energy from the Sun. Solar energy radiating back out to space from the Earth’s surface is absorbed by atmospheric 
greenhouse gases and re-emitted in all directions. The energy that radiates back down to the planet heats both the lower atmosphere 
and the surface. Without this effect, the Earth would be 30 degrees Celsius colder, making our planet hostile to life,” states BBC. 
New technologies and advanced activities are responsible for this climate change as well as humans. The EPA is the Environmental 
Protection Agency that takes care of issues like climate change. Climatologists are scientists that study the climate. 
Ninety percent of the climatologists believe that climate change is a big concern. 
They have already started to see the negative impact climate change is having on Earth and the species living in it. 
The climatologists believe that if we don’t take an action soon all the species on Earth will be in danger. 
There are some people that believe that global warming is simply manmade and it is not real. 
While there are some other people that believe that even if global warming is real, it will only benefit the Earth. 
They believe that all the species and human will be able to adapt to a warmer Earth. 
However, there is a lot of scientific research that proves that global warming is real and very detrimental. 
We chose this topic because there are many people in this world that do not know about global warming. 
There are also some ignorant people that do not care about Earth. We want to use this research paper to raise 
awareness for climate change because it is not getting as much attention as it should.

<h2> What Can We Do To Help? </h2>
<p> 
Our planet needs us and there are numerous techniques we can use to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, 
and eventually stop our climate from changing so rapidly. So go fly a kite. Take a walk. Kick a ball. 
Climb a tree. Look at the stars! Having fun outdoors - instead of staying inside and watching TV - 
is one way you can shrink the amount of carbon dioxide that’s produced when you use energy that 
comes from burning fossil fuels (Barrett et al, 2009). This is a perfect example of how people can help to
stop climate change just by changing our oblivious habits that damage the environment. We do not need advanced
technology for this. All we have to do is ponder over our choices and change the way we do the most basic things in life. 
These insignificant and fundamental activities are responsible for this dangerous problem. 
Changing our way might not have a big impact on our lifestyles, but it will definitely have a big positive impact on our climate. 
“When you buy your next car, look for the one with the best fuel economy in its class. Each gallon of gas you use is responsible 
for 25 pounds of heat - trapping gases in the atmosphere. Even in reasonably tight homes, air leaks may account for 15 to 25 percent 
of the heat our furnaces generate in winter or that our homes gain in summer” (Hance, 2017). People should also use energy efficient 
appliances. As Hance stated, vehicles play a big role in this detrimental climate change. If people become more cautious when buying 
their vehicles, then maybe someday the atmospheric levels of these greenhouse gases will decrease. These ways will benefit Earth as 
well as all the species and humans. Energy efficient appliances will also reduce the electricity bill. It is a winning situation for 
all because while we will be working towards diminishing and ceasing climate change, we will also be saving a lot of money.
“People will have to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from a variety of sources with technologies available in the next 
few decades, rather than relying on an enormous change in a single area” (N/A, 2016). “Countries must drastically cut their 
carbon emissions now or the world will face disastrous climate changes in the future, the author contend” (Roleff, 1997). 
“To avoid the worst outcomes, the world would need to act immediately and drastically reducing emissions 41 to 72 percent 
below 2010 levels by mid century. We’d then need to keep cutting and possibly be taking carbon-dioxide back out of the 
atmosphere by 2100” (Plumer, 2014). These quotes show that everyone will have to work together and reduce the greenhouse 
gas emissions. If we want to make a difference and stop climate change, then we will have to work together in order to stop it. 
This is not something that will happen with a few people’s effort. This is an issue that needs everyone’s attention because it 
will take a lot of people to slowly reduce the greenhouse gases’ levels from the atmosphere. Bill Nye also stated that people 
should recycle/reuse stuff, walk instead of taking public transportation, unplug their electronics when not using them, eat less meat,
 and eat more locally grown veggies.
